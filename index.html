        <p>Hello, my name is KyungIn (Julia) Kim, and I am a rising senior at Bryn Mawr College. I am currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Chinese at Haverford College through Bi-College Consortium, so I do think myself as a Haverford student sometimes :)
        </p>
        <p>I have been travelling internationally since I was seven. I was born and raised in Republic of Korea, and when I was seven, I went to Dalian, China to learn Chinese and experience quite a different educational system. After living in China for seven years, I went to Hawaii for a year and half to learn English. Although it was nice living in Hawaii, I was not happy with the public school system there, so I moved to Virginia (came to the "mainland") and spent my high school years in Virginia. Four years of high school was the longest time for me to spend at one school, which I genuinely enjoyed. Then, I came to Bryn Mawr College, located in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
        </p>
        <p>I appreciate my parents for all things they have done for my brother and me, including allowing me to grow up in different cultural backgrounds. My goal of life is to be a filial daughter to my parents, and I have been working hard towards that goal. Currently I am looking for a summer internship for me to get a step closer to getting a job after graduation and support my parents.
